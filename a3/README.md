#### Comment on the frequency of exits â€“ does the number of exits increase at a stable rate?

The number of exits does not seems to increase at a stable rate. 

#### Or are there more exits performed during certain VM operations?

External Interrrupt, Interrupt Window , Control-register access, and IO seems to have a lot of exits.

#### Approximately how many exits does a full VM boot entail?

Roughly 500k.
